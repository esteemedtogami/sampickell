        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a graduate student at UMass Lowell studying computer
          science working part time with Boxford Cable Access TV. I have taken
          classes for C, C++, Python, Java, and functional programming
          languages, as well as classes that have explored the fundamentals of
          Computer Algorithms, Data Communication, Network & Security,
          Databasing, and Data Mining. In May of 2019, I graduated with a
          Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from UMass Lowell, and am
          currently in the accelerated BS/MS program at UMass Lowell with the
          intent of getting my Master's of Science degree in May 2020. Outside
          of my studies, I am very interested in film (specifically video
          editing) and computer hardware (having built several PCs from
          scratch). While computer science is my primary focus, my hobbies along
          with music are very important to me and are areas that I hope to
          continue to grow in.
